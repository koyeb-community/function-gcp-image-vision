## Summary
GCP Image Vision is an image detection service that allows you to add Google image analysis technology to your applications. The GCP Image Vision function allows you to detect people, faces, explicit content, logos, objects, text, and labels such as locations and activities in images.

This function comes with the following variants:

* **Image properties**, to detect general attributes of the image, such as dominant color.
* **Label Detection**, to return labels about an image. It will detect general objects, locations, activities, animal species, products and more. Labels are returned in English.
* **Logo Detection**, to identify popular logos within an image. It returns their coordinates and description.
* **Object Detection**, to detect multiple objects in an image and provides information for each object in the image. For each object, you will get the position of the object, and rectangular bounds for the region of the image that contains the object.
* **Image explicit content detection**, to detect content such as adult or violent content within an image. It can be used in automated moderation systems.
* **Image OCR**, to detect the text in the image. You will get the entire extracted string, as well as individual words, and their bounding boxes.
* **Image Web Detection**, to find similar images on the web. With this variant, you can find duplicate images or similar images on the internet.
